----------------
Create a REST API that will allow users to register, create a list of bookmarks.

Users must have:

* username
* password

Bookmarks must have:
* URI - Uniform Resource Identifier
* Description

Persistence will be done either with JPA or plain JDBC.

It will use spring boot.

Must have unit tests.

Ideally should have integration tests.

Bonus - users can share bookmarks between them
